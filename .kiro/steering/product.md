# Product Overview

SF.gov Wagtail Extension is a cross-browser extension that provides content management information for SF.gov pages. When users navigate to SF.gov pages, the extension displays a side panel showing:

- Page metadata (title, content type, partner agency)
- Direct edit links to the Wagtail CMS admin interface
- Available translations with language codes
- Media assets (images and documents) used on the page

The extension integrates with the SF.gov Wagtail CMS API to retrieve real-time page information, helping content managers and administrators quickly access CMS tools and page details without leaving the browser.
